This project is an C++ program that can manage a library. It can keep book datas, and make their followings.

This program can use with just DEV-CPP v5.11. Other IDE's may not work.

If you want to create your own book data, just copy the code and execute in a new folder. Then you can add new books
in the program's menu. (Just use the program as usual.)
